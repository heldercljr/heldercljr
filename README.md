# üëã Hi there

I'm Helder Chaves, Software Engineer, Computer Science student and lover of technology! I'm currently ending the third year of the course at [Federal University of Campina Grande](https://www.computacao.ufcg.edu.br/). With over 7 years of experience developing software and studying the CS fundamentals, I've had the opportunity to engage on some exciting projects and explore different technologies.

# üë®üèª‚Äçüíª About me

Since I was a child, I have always been interested in understanding how things work, and this curiosity led me to choose a career in the area of information technology. Questioning myself is part of my essence and my scientific spirit, and this behavior has shaped me into a very creative person with a great critical sense focused on logic, at the same time that it has also made me interested in subjects such as philosophy, sociology and politics. I believe in technology's ability to make our lives easier and remind us of what makes us human, and this reveals that seeking professional and personal development is also part of who I am.

# üöÄ My job Experiences

Since 2021, I had the great opportunity to work in two different places, acting as back-end developer and researcher:

From July 2021 to December 2021, I was a JavaScript/TypeScript developer at [Smartiks](https://www.smartiks.com/). It was my first professional experience, and I had the opportunity to put my knowledge in practice using Node.js, Express, and TypeORM. The company collaborates with players in the electrical sector such as CHESF and ENGIE. My role involved using TDD with the Jest framework, code versioning with GitLab and GitHub, and working with SQLite and Oracle relational databases. I also handled tasks related to Docker containers and applied agile development methodologies, specifically scrum with Azure, throughout the development lifecycle.

From February 2023 to January 2024, I worked as a Python developer and researcher at [SPLab](https://splab.computacao.ufcg.edu.br/), a research laboratory located on UFCG. My responsibilities included developing tools for PDF data extraction and processing, utilizing Jira, Gitlab, and Discord for management, versioning, and communication. I also studied and applied image processing techniques using computer vision, regularly presenting and discussing ideas to enhance my professional skills. This work allowed me to be more independent as a developer, in addition to being the first one I worked in person.
